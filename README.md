## üñºÔ∏è Image Upload Notes

Image upload functionality allows users to add photos to posts. However, since the project does not use JavaScript, images **do not preview before submission**.

> This is intentional. Image preview requires JavaScript, which is outside this project's scope.

The image will display correctly after the post is created.
